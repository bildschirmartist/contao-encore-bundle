# Install frontend assets using webpack

If you want to add the frontend assets (JS & CSS) to your project using webpack, please
add [foxy/foxy](https://github.com/fxpio/foxy) to the dependencies of your project's `composer.json` and add the following to its `config` section:

```json
"foxy": {
  "manager": "yarn",
  "manager-version": "^1.5.0"
}
```

Using this, foxy will automatically add the needed yarn packages to your project's `node_modules` folder.

If you want to specify which frontend assets to use on a per page level, you can use [heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle).
