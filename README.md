# Contao Encore Bundle

This bundle offers a wrapper for comfortably using symfony encore asset management in Contao projects (3rd party bundles are also supported if compatible).

## Features

- use the full power of symfony encore/webpack in your Contao project
- conditionally load your project assets only when necessary on a particular page<br>
  (if 3rd party bundles have some configuration in their config.yml, this goes also for 3rd party bundles' assets)
